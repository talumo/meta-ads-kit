# Meta Ads Copilot

An open-source AI ad manager that replaces 20 minutes of Ads Manager clicking with a 2-minute summary over coffee.

**Monitor → Detect Fatigue → Find Winners → Shift Budget → Generate Copy → Upload to Meta → Repeat**

This kit automates your entire Meta Ads workflow:

- **Morning briefing** — Spend pacing, active campaigns, 7-day trends
- **Find bleeders** — Ads with high spend + low CTR bleeding your budget
- **Spot winners** — Top performers ready to scale
- **Detect fatigue** — CTR declining, frequency climbing, CPC rising
- **Generate copy** — AI writes ad copy matched to your actual image creatives
- **Upload to Meta** — Push new ads straight to your account via Graph API
- **Take action** — Pause, resume, adjust budgets (always with your approval)

The result: A full ad management loop — from monitoring to creative refresh — without opening Ads Manager.

## Why This Exists

I've spent 20 years in marketing. Scaled Fireball Whisky from one state to a billion-dollar global brand. Ran campaigns for Heineken, Hennessy, Buffalo Trace. Now I run [Emerald Digital](https://emerald.digital), an AI-first marketing agency.

Here's what I learned: 90% of ad management is pattern recognition. Spend trending up or down. CTR declining (creative fatigue). CPA spiking (audience exhaustion). Winners emerging. Losers bleeding.

You don't need to stare at Ads Manager to spot these patterns. An AI agent can do it and tell you what matters.

I'm open-sourcing this because every founder running Meta ads deserves a copilot.

```

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## The 5 Daily Questions

The core of the system. Five questions that replace Ads Manager:

| # | Question | What It Tells You |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Am I on track? | Today's spend vs. pacing expectations |
| 2 | What's running? | Active campaigns at a glance |
| 3 | How's performance? | 7-day metrics by campaign |
| 4 | Who's winning/losing? | Ad-level performance sorted |
| 5 | Any fatigue? | CTR trends, frequency, CPC movement |

```bash
# Run all 5 questions
./run.sh daily-check

# Or with OpenClaw agent
openclaw start
# Then message: "Daily ads check"
```

---

## Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `meta-ads` | Core reporting — daily checks, campaign insights, bleeders, winners, fatigue detection |
| `ad-creative-monitor` | Track creative performance over time, detect fatigue before it kills your ROAS |
| `budget-optimizer` | Analyze spend efficiency, recommend budget shifts between campaigns/adsets |
| `ad-copy-generator` | Generate ad copy matched to specific image creatives — analyzes the visual, writes copy that reinforces it, outputs `asset_feed_spec`-ready variants |
| `ad-upload` | Push images and copy straight to Meta via Graph API — no Ads Manager copy-paste required |

Each skill can run standalone or as part of the daily routine.

### The Full Loop

The five skills chain together into a closed loop:

```
Monitor (meta-ads) → Detect fatigue (ad-creative-monitor) → Shift budget (budget-optimizer)
    → Generate new copy (ad-copy-generator) → Upload to Meta (ad-upload) → Monitor again
```

No Ads Manager required at any step.

**Morning (automated via cron):**
1. Run daily-check — flag bleeders, winners, and fatigue
2. Send strategist-level briefing to Slack/Telegram with recommendations and new creative concepts
3. You approve from your phone

**When you need new creatives:**
1. Generate copy matched to specific image creatives
2. Review the variants
3. Upload directly to Meta — images, copy, and all

**You (2 minutes over coffee):**
1. Read the summary
2. Approve/reject recommendations
3. Done.

## Running With OpenClaw

This kit is built for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), an open-source AI agent framework.

```bash
# Install OpenClaw
npm install -g openclaw

# Set up the agent
cd meta-ads-kit
openclaw start
```

Then just message it naturally:

- "How are my ads doing?"
- "Any bleeders I should pause?"
- "Which ads should I scale?"
- "Check for creative fatigue"
- "Show me performance by age and gender"
- "Pause ad 12345678"

The agent handles the orchestration, interprets the data, and asks before taking any action.

### Automate It

Set up a daily cron in OpenClaw:

```
"Run my daily ads check every morning at 8am and send me the summary"
```

The agent will run the 5 questions, analyze the results, and message you with findings + recommendations. You approve from your phone.

## Configuration

Edit `ad-config.json` to set your benchmarks:

```json
{
  "account": {
    "id": "act_123456789",
    "name": "My Brand"
  },
  "benchmarks": {
    "target_cpa": 25.00,
    "target_roas": 3.0,
    "max_frequency": 3.5,
    "min_ctr": 1.0,
    "max_cpc": 2.50
  },
  "alerts": {
    "bleeder_ctr_threshold": 1.0,
    "bleeder_frequency_threshold": 3.5,
    "fatigue_ctr_drop_pct": 20,
    "spend_pace_alert_pct": 15
  },
  "reporting": {
    "default_preset": "last_7d",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }
}
```

Or just tell the OpenClaw agent your benchmarks conversationally — it'll figure it out.

Stop babysitting Ads Manager. Let your AI copilot do the watching.

Star the repo if this helps. It tells me to keep building.
